# DualMCU

The Unit DualMCU board integrates the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller and the Espressif ESP32 WROOM chip into a single module, allowing you to make the most of the 32-bit dual-core ARM® Cortex®-M0+ processor to develop Internet of Things (IoT) projects with Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi connectivity.

DualMCU has been conceived as a mix between two 32-bit microprocessors: a Raspberry RP2040 with a Cortex M0+ core at 133 MHz and an Espressif ESP32 that reaches up to 240 MHz. In this way, we combine the power of both microcontrollers into a single development board. With a PCB size of 36mm x 84mm and using surface mount technology, four programmable cores with wireless functions and very low power consumption are integrated.

### Support

The DualMCU development board is compatible with integrated development environments such as Micropython (e.g., Thonny) and also with the Arduino environment. This means you can program the DualMCU using both Micropython or Circuitpython, as well as the Arduino language.

Support for Micropython includes an interactive console (REPL) that allows you to execute commands immediately, making it easy to test and debug your code.

Additionally, support for Arduino allows you to take advantage of the tools and extensive Arduino user community to develop projects with the DualMCU board, which is especially useful if you are already familiar with this environment.
