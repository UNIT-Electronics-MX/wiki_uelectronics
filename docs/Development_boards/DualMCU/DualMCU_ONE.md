# DualMCU ONE

The **UNIT DualMCU-ONE** is a highly versatile development board that integrates the power of two microcontrollers: the ESP32 and the RP2040. Designed for advanced IoT, robotics, and industrial applications, it offers enhanced connectivity, robust power management, and full compatibility with Arduino UNO shields.


:::warning
The DualMCU-ONE operates with 3.3V logic levels instead of the Arduino Unoâ€™s typical 5V.
Make sure any shield or peripheral connected is compatible with 3.3V logic to avoid potential damage.
